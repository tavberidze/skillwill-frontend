        factTitle: 'THE TITLE CHARACTER WAS NAMED AFTER EMILY WATSON.',
        factDesc: 'Director and co-writer Jean-Pierre Jeunet wrote the part, in French, for English actress Emily Watson, and named the main character Emily. When Jeunet realized Watson’s considerable acting talent didn’t come across as well when she wasn’t speaking her native language, he revised the script to indicate Emily had grown up in England. But Watson eventually dropped out of the project, saying she didn’t want to be away from home for six months. (She made Gosford Park instead.) Jeunet and co-writer Guillaume Laurant changed the character back to being 100 percent French, and changed her name to the more Gallic Amélie. '

        factTitle: 'JEUNET FOUND HIS STAR ON A MOVIE POSTER.',
        factDesc: 'According to Jeunet, he was walking the streets of Paris not long after Emily Watson dropped out, pondering her replacement, when he saw a poster for Venus Beauty, featuring one Audrey Tautou. “I was struck by a pair of dark eyes, a flash of innocence, an unusual demeanor,” he said. “I set up a meeting and she tried for the part. After 10 seconds, I knew she was the one.” '

        factTitle: 'A WHOLE BUNCH OF GIRLS ARE NAMED AMÉLIE BECAUSE OF IT.',
        factDesc: 'Assuming, in this case, that correlation equals causation. In 2000, the year before the movie came out, there were 12 babies in England and Wales given the name Amélie. The number shot up to 250 in 2002, and by 2007, there were around 1,100 new Amélies per year. The number has held steady ever since. The trend was similar in the U.S., with Amélie not among the 1,000 most popular names until 2003, when it suddenly leapt to 839th place and rose from there.'
